The **quanteda** team aims to introduce the advantages and possibilities of quantatative text analysis to academics from all disciplines as well as people working in the public or private sector. We are enthusiastic about our package and aim to explain **quanteda** in a comprehensible and comprehensive way to a broad audience.

We have organized workshops in Germany, Japan, Israel and the United Kingdom. The events can range from half-day introductions to the **quanteda** package to multi-day courses that cover a broader introduction to the R statistical programming language and **quanteda**.

Currently, the workshops can be taught in English, German or Japanese. If you would like to get an impression of the material that can be covered, please see the materials of past workshops:

- [Quanteda tutorials](http://tutorials.quanteda.io): a step-by-step introduction to quantitative text analysis using **quanteda**
- [Quantitative Text Analysis Using R](https://github.com/kbenoit/QTAUR-halfday): a half-day course in English
- [Introduction to Japanese Text Analysis Using R](https://github.com/koheiw/IJTA): a short half-day course in Japanese
- [Introduction to Text Analysis Using R](https://github.com/kbenoit/ITAUR): a two-day tutorial

If you are interested in hosting a workshop at your institution, do not hesitate to get in contact with [Kenneth Benoit](kbenoit@lse.ac.uk), the creator and maintainer of **quanteda**.
