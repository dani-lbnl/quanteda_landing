## Objectives

**quanteda** is developed to achieve following core objectives in quantitative text analysis. 

1. Simplicity and flexibility
    * Create flexible tools for different analytic purposes
    * Provide consistent and intuitive commands for R users
2. Best practice
    * Facilitate transparent and reproducible workflows
3. High efficiency
    * Exploit multi-core CPU's to process large datasets
    * Store large datasets in small RAMs of laptop computers  
4. Inter-operability 
    * Allow **quanteda** to be used in conjunction with other R packages
