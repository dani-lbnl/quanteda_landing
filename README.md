## How to edit the top page?
Texts elements on the top page are defined in YAML files in the `data` folder. Images are created by me using illustrator. 

## How to edit about?
Just edit `content/about.md`

## How to update news?
Add/remove/edit files in `content/news`.

After making changes, do not forget to click 'Build Website' in the build panel in R Studio.
